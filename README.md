## Simple wrapper for annoying OR statements

Hey! That's my first open-source package, so don't blame on me üòè

#### Philosophy

To be or not to be?
It's very annoying to write OR statements in JS with a lot of variants like this:

```
const a = 'foo';

if (a === 'foo' || a === 'buz' || a === 'foobuz') {}
```

Instead of this I have made this small package, where you can pass variable and array with value variants:

```
if (tobeor(a, ['foo', 'buz', 'foobuz'])) {}
```

Function just returns true or false and that's it.
Package pretty simple - it's just one line of code, that use .includes() method to check truthfulness of statement.

#### How to install

If you use NPM: `npm i tobeor`
